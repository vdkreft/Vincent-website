# Environmental Personality

## About the Creator:

Hello! My name is Vincent Kreft and I am a chemistry major at UC Berkeley. I am a science-passionate and hardworking student intrigued by the chemical processes of the body. Also, I am an environmental enthusiast who understands that planetary health and human health are interrelated with a goal to conduct research that answers questions at that intersection.

## About the Website:
The goal of this website is to exhibit the importance of tackling climate anxiety and how individuals can turn to their community to reduce their environmental stress while providing positive impact to the movement. I will be doing this by not only educating you about the prevalence of climate anxiety, but also create an interactive profiling test that categorizes you into a climate anxiety "personality" (Think <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16 Personalities Test</a>).

This website is a work in progress, the profiling test has yet to be tackled. Thank you for understanding that a new coder needs time!

## Climate Anxiety

### Why is Climate Anxiety Important?

Hickman et. al. (2021) conducted a global youth climate anxiety survey with 10,000 respondents across ten countries. The findings were alarming as 84% of global youth (75% of US) were at least moderately worried about climate change.

I am a resident of a coal state—according to the US Energy Information Administration, Indiana ranked 3rd in the nation in coal consumption in 2020—so I was curious to replicate the global survey to see if youth in my state are equally anxious. I received 1,349 responses from high-school and college students in my hometown of Bloomington, IN, and 80% were at least moderately worried about climate change, five percentage points more than the US.

Looking at these data visualizations, it is clear that climate anxiety is incredibly prevalent in the modern era. Combining these data findings with the knowledge that mental health is linked to physical health, it is clear that if we continue on this "climate inaction" trajectory, we will be entrenched in a society of poor health (both physically and mentally). Therefore, by tackling climate anxiety, we are enacting preventative medicine.
